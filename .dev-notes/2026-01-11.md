## Fixed: baseline-browser-mapping Warning

### Problem
The following warning appeared repeatedly when running tests or builds:

```
[baseline-browser-mapping] The data in this module is over two months old.
To ensure accurate Baseline data, please update:
`npm i baseline-browser-mapping@latest -D`
```

### Cause
The `baseline-browser-mapping` package provides browser compatibility data used by `browserslist` (part of the Babel/Next.js toolchain). When the data is more than 2 months old, it triggers this warning.

The installed version was `2.8.24`, which was outdated.

Dependency chain:
- `next@16.1.1` → `baseline-browser-mapping`
- `@vitejs/plugin-react` → `@babel/core` → `browserslist` → `baseline-browser-mapping`

### Solution
Run:
```bash
npm update baseline-browser-mapping
```

This updated the package from `2.8.24` to `2.9.14`, resolving the warning.

### Verification
```bash
npm ls baseline-browser-mapping
npm test  # No more warning
```
